# PostfixMaster

PostfixMaster is an interactive command-line tool designed to effortlessly compute postfix expressions, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). PostfixMaster allows users to input mathematical expressions in postfix notation, distinguishing between numbers, operators (+, -, *, /), and potential variable names.

Equipped with the ability to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, PostfixMaster ensures precise computation every time. Its intuitive interface leverages stacks as the primary data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of data, guaranteeing swift performance.

Need to store variables for later use? PostfixMaster's built-in symbol table functionality allows you to save key-value pairs, modify existing entries, and retrieve values whenever needed.

Whether you're a seasoned mathematician or a programming enthusiast, PostfixMaster simplifies computations with its user-friendly interface that tells the steps taken to calculate the result. Experience seamless postfix expression evaluation like never before with PostfixMaster.

## How to use it?

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use PostfixMaster:

1. **Launch the Application**: Start by clicking on the executable file for the RPN calculator.

2. **Understand Postfix Expression**: Familiarise yourself with the concept of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or postfix expression. In this notation, every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, "22+" computes the sum of 2 and 2, resulting in 4, while "37*" computes the product of 3 and 7, resulting in 21.

3. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**: Input your postfix expression directly into the calculator. For example, to compute "2+2", type "22+" and press Enter. The calculator will promptly evaluate the expression and display the result.

4. **Assign Variables**: To assign a variable, type a CAPITAL letter from A to Z followed by "=", then input the value you want to assign to the variable. For instance, to assign the value 5 to variable A, type "A5=" and press Enter.

5. **Manage Symbol Table**: Every time you create or update a variable, you'll be prompted whether you want to print the symbol table or not. The symbol table is where all the variables are stored and can be retrieved. You can choose to print it to keep track of your variables.

6. **Exit the Application**: To exit the application, simply click on the exit button.

By following these steps, you can efficiently compute postfix expressions, assign variables, and manage the symbol table using PostfixMaster. Enjoy streamlined mathematical operations and organised data management!
