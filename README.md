# Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator

This RPN Calculator & Symbol Table Manager is a versatile command-line tool designed to effortlessly compute postfix expressions and manage variables in a symbol table. Whether you're crunching numbers or manipulating variables, this application has you covered.

With support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators, simply input your postfix expression, and let the calculator swiftly evaluate the result.

Need to store variables for later use? Our built-in symbol table functionality allows you to save key-value pairs, modify existing entries, and retrieve values whenever needed.

## How to use it?

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the RPN Calculator & Symbol Table Manager:

1. **Launch the Application**: Start by clicking on the executable file for the RPN calculator.

2. **Understand Postfix Expression**: Familiarise yourself with the concept of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or postfix expression. In this notation, every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, "22+" computes the sum of 2 and 2, resulting in 4, while "37*" computes the product of 3 and 7, resulting in 21.

3. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**: Input your postfix expression directly into the calculator. For example, to compute "2+2", type "22+" and press Enter. The calculator will promptly evaluate the expression and display the result.

4. **Assign Variables**: To assign a variable, type a CAPITAL letter from A to Z followed by "=", then input the value you want to assign to the variable. For instance, to assign the value 5 to variable A, type "A5=" and press Enter.

5. **Manage Symbol Table**: Every time you create or update a variable, you'll be prompted whether you want to print the symbol table or not. The symbol table is where all the variables are stored and can be retrieved. You can choose to print it to keep track of your variables.

6. **Exit the Application**: To exit the application, simply click on the exit button.

By following these steps, you can efficiently compute postfix expressions, assign variables, and manage the symbol table using the RPN Calculator & Symbol Table Manager. Enjoy streamlined mathematical operations and organised data management!
